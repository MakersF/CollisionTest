CollisionTest
=============

NOTE: the current development of the collision library changed repository!!
Grab the most updated version at the [CollisionCore Project Page](https://github.com/MakersF/CollisionCore) (this is a generic framework for collision, and has a binding for using with normal java, non android, programs bundled in).
To use the CollisionCore library inside AndEngine, you can get the AndEngine binging from https://github.com/MakersF/AndEngineCollisionsExtension
